#PSY 441 Capstone Project

###Sara Reese

##Introduction

This repository contains my Senior capstone project.

Remember, if you're wondering how I did something in the repository, take a look
at the code.

The data, analyses, images, and presentations all represent a reproducible real
world example. The data come from my
[Survey Monkey Experiment](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GXH5KGK). They
were processed and analyzed in R. Results of these analyses were written up
in a poster that was presented to my professor.

##Guide to the Repository Contents
* **data**: a folder containing the following.
    * data files
        * Results.csv: Data from the Survey Monkey Experiment.
        * Analysis.Rmd: An R Markdown file that walk through my data analyses and creates the figure I used for my poster.
        * data: The compiled data with information about other variables suitable
        for analysis.
        * temp: Data table showing response and frequency based on condition.
    * Codebook rawdat.md: codebook that explains the data in the data files.
    * analysis files
    * Rplot.png: The figure I created for the presentation.
* **materials**: a folder containing materials used in the experiments. To minimize
the size of this repository, many files used to create the survey are missing, but
the end products can be found in the above link to the experiment.
    * Consent Form: The consent form used for the experiment.
    * Debriefing From: The PowerPoint files I used to create stimuli for the
    experimental conditions and debriefing.
    *Flyer: Flyer used to recruit participants on the university campus.
    *Survey Monkey Link: Links to the Survey Monkey survey we used for our capstone experiment.
* **presentation**: A folder containing the presentation materials that includes:
    * Capstone Project.pdf: A pdf of the poster used for printing and distribution.
    * Capstone Project.ppts: A presentation file used to create the poster.
